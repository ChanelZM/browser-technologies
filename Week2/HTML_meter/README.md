# The ```<meter>``` tag
## What's that?
> The meter element represents a scalar measurement within a known range, or a fractional value; for example disk usage, the relevance of a query result, or the fraction of a voting population to have selected a particular candidate. This is also known as a gauge.(1).

The meter element is basically a bar which indicates a part of something whole and **not** the progress of something (if you want to use an element for progress use ```<progress>```).

## Browser support
![Javascript](https://github.com/ChanelZM/browser-technologies/blob/master/Week2/HTML_meter/img/CanIUse_meter.png)

## Syntax
```html
<meter max="" min="" value="" high="" low="" optimum=""></meter>
```

Meter has a start and an end tag. We could use this to put fallbacks between these tags (1).
