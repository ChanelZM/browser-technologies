# CSS Grid Layout
## What's that?
CSS Grid Layout is designed for a two dimensional design, where flexbox was made for a one dimensional design. With flexbox you could only tell which direction the content was supposed to go and try to get every thing in a block-like structure with flex-wrap. With Grid Layout you could easily make a block structure by telling every individual block where to start and end. You can also give the gutter a with.

## Browser support

## Syntax
```
.parent {
display: grid | inline-grid | subgrid; 
```
Specifies that you are using grid| if the element is already in a grid, you can use subgrid to use the grid properties of the parent
```
grid-template-columns:40px 50px 60px 40px;
```
Specifies the width of every cell, and because there are 4 sizes, the grid has 4 columns
```
grid-template-rows:40px 40px auto; 
```
Specifies the height of the cells, the grid has 3 rows
```
grid-template-areas: 
"<grid-area-name> | . | none | ..."
"<grid-area-name> | . | none | ..."
"<grid-area-name> | . | none | ...";
```
Specifies the grid template. You can use the names of the children to indicate which one is placed at which location
```
grid-column-gap: 10px; 
```
Specifies the gutter of the columns.
```
grid-row-gap: 20px; 
```
Specifies the gutter of the rows.
```
justify-items: start | end | center | stretch; 
```
start: all child elements left| end: all child elements right| center: (speaks for itself)| stretch: fills the whole cell.
```
align-items: start | end | center | stretch;
```
start: all child elements top| end: all child elements bottom| stretch: fills the whole cell.
```
justify-content: start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly;
```
start: the whole grid on the left| end: grid on the right| stretch: fits the container| space-around: space between the columns is evenly| space-between: left column floats left and right column floats right and the gutter is spaced evenly| space-evenly: the columns are spaced evenly in the container.
```
align-content:start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly;
```
Same as justify content but it is used horizontally for the rows.
```
grid-auto-columns: 60px 70px;
```
Specifies the size for the autogenerated columns, cells that don't have a set value get this value.
```
grid-auto-rows:40px 50px;
```
Specifies the size for the autogenerated rows, cells that don't have a set value get this value.
```
grid-auto-flow: row | column | row dense | column dense;
```
Specifies how the autogenerated cells should be displayed. row: items in a row | column: kind of like flexwrap but then vertical.
```
}

.child {
grid-column-start: 2;
grid-column-end: 4;
grid-row-start: 2;
grid-row-end: 5;
```
In grid you tell the browser from which line to which line an item should go both for column and row.
```
justify-self:start | end | center | stretch;
align-self: start | end | center | stretch;
```
Just like the parent, you can use justify-self and align-self, but it will only affect the item.
```
}
```

You could also use shorthands to compress your code.

## About the demo and fallbacks
[DEMO](https://chanelzm.github.io/browser-technologies/Week2/CSS_grid/)

In the demo the block-like structure works first works on float, because float works on every browser. The sections in the body are ```inline-block``` and they are given a specific width, then float is used to create a block structure. The code looks like this (on desktop):
```
section {
    float: right;
    width: 20rem;
}
```

With ```@supports``` feature detection flexbox is being used to create that same kind of block-structure. The code looks like this:
```
@supports(display:flex) {
    body {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    section {
        width: 20rem;
    }
}
```

And lastly, when the browser does support Grid Layout. I use this code to make the same block-structure but with different cell widths, the strength of Grid Layout:
```
@supports(display:grid){
    section {
        width: auto;
    }
    body {
        grid-template-columns: auto 30rem auto;
        grid-template-rows: 20rem 25rem 22rem 21rem;
        grid-column-gap: 1rem;
        grid-row-gap: 2rem;
    }
}
```

The block-structure is also responsive (with all three features).
